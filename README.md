# Library Management System


This Java-based application streamlines library management operations through a clean and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It enables librarians, students, and administrators to efficiently handle core library activities such as book management, user records, and transactions. The system uses a MySQL database managed via phpMyAdmin for reliable data storage and retrieval, and introduces a dedicated Publisher entity to improve book organization and tracking.
